## Advanced Geometry

These are the course notes for Advanced Geometry used at Ohio State University.

They were initially developed by Herb Clemens. 

Later, Bart Snapp edited, and converted them to a Ximera format.

Fedor Manin made a number of additions in Spring of 2019, including writing matrix multiplication on the left.
